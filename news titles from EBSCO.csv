Evening Standard. 8/11/2017, p14. 1p. Abstract: THE news that Google's spectacular new headquarters at King's Cross have been given approval by planners at Camden council is welcome confirmation both of London's ability to attract continued investment from world-leading companies and of its willingness to allow striking architectural design to project this city as a forwardthinking place open to innovation. Equally importantly, the 5,000 or so employees whom the new building will house are exactly the sort of talented professionals who can help London thrive in the post-Brexit era. In the meantime, a bold idea to make London into an urban National Park has today won the support of Mayor Sadiq Khan. The aim of the plan is to make London greener. Potential planning restrictions that would come with park status might make the scheme impractical in a dynamic city. But imaginative thinking such as this should be encouraged and parts of the idea, at least, could be considered. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER] Reading Level (Lexile): 1430.

By: Vaidhyanathan, Siva. Chronicle of Higher Education. 12/2/2005, Vol. 52 Issue 15, pB7-B10. 4p. 1 Color Photograph, 1 Black and White Photograph. Abstract: This article reports that Google Inc., the Mountain View, California, company flying high off a huge initial public offering of stock and astounding quarterly revenues, announced late last year that it would digitize millions of bound books from five major English-language libraries. It plans to make available online the full text of public-domain books and excerpts from works still in copyright. Harvard University will allow Google to scan 40,000 books during the pilot phase of the project, and the number may grow. The library has more than 15 million volumes. The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor has agreed to let Google scan its entire collection, some 7.8 million works, and Stanford University says it is keeping open the possibility of including potentially millions of its more than eight million volumes. The Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford will allow Google to scan public-domain books, which it says are principally those published before 1920. Google is doing all the scanning and optical-character recognition with a secret proprietary machine and promises not to damage the pages or bindings.
